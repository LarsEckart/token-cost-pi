          There were three. The lede stood on the strip's line at the top, which mirrored the
          report's own three bands and read, on the empty face, as an orphan: a centred sentence
          under a left-aligned title, then a hundred pixels of nothing before the thing it was
          introducing. It belongs to the ask, so it now stands with it. */}

            has no reason to know, and asking for files put them in a picker with a hidden dotfile
            to defeat and dozens of identically-named transcripts to multi-select; asking for the
            one folder is a single pick that catches everything under it. Loose files dragged in
            still work -- the filter above does not care how they arrived -- there is just no
            longer a button that recommends it. */}

            of carry cost -- which is the right paragraph in the wrong place: it argued for numbers
            to a reader who had not seen any. Then it was a promise and a row of three things you
            get, one of which ("by project, by session") the engine does not do: nothing here
            groups by project, and sessions are counted rather than broken out. Then it opened
            "Drop the folder in and", which is what the heading directly above it now says. Then it
